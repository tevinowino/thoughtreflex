# ThoughtReflex - Your AI-Powered Therapy Journal

ThoughtReflex is a web application designed to be your personal AI-powered therapist and emotional journal. It provides a safe, intelligent, and reflective space for users to explore their thoughts and emotions, fostering self-awareness and promoting mental well-being. It's also installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for a more app-like experience.

**Reflect deeply. Heal gently.**

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Journaling (Mira)**: Engage in empathetic, chat-based conversations with Mira, your AI companion. Mira is designed to help you explore and understand your feelings.
    *   **Contextual AI Conversations**: Mira remembers the flow of your current journaling session (last ~10 messages) and considers your name, active goal, MBTI type, and detected emotional patterns to provide relevant follow-ups.
    *   **AI-Suggested Goals**: During your journaling sessions, Mira may suggest actionable goals for self-improvement based on your conversation (especially in Coach mode). You can easily add these to your goal list.
    *   **AI-Powered Thought Reframing (Mind Shift Tool)**: When explicitly asked (e.g., "Can you help me reframe this thought: ...?"), Mira uses a specialized tool to help you identify and reframe negative thought patterns using cognitive restructuring principles. You can save these "Mind Shifts" to review later.
    *   **Proactive Gentle Suggestions**: Mira offers gentle, relevant suggestions for self-care, coping, or reflection woven into the conversation.
*   **Adaptive Therapist Modes**: Tailor Mira's interaction style to your current needs by choosing between:
    *   **Therapist Mode**: For deep, reflective, and slow-paced conversations.
    *   **Coach Mode**: For motivational, structured guidance, helping you work towards your goals.
    *   **Friend Mode**: For casual, warm, and supportive conversations.
*   **Traditional Notebook**: A private, non-AI space for your unfiltered thoughts, free-writing, or quick notes.
    *   **Rich Text Features**: Includes real-time word/character count and a "last saved" indicator with autosave functionality.
    *   **Handwriting Font**: Content area uses a handwriting-style font for a more personal feel.
    *   **Search & Filter**: Easily find entries by searching titles and content.
    *   **Clear Entry**: Option to quickly clear the content of an entry with confirmation.
*   **Goal Setting & Tracking**: Define, manage, and track your personal healing and growth milestones. Mark goals as complete and edit them as needed. Mira can reference your active goals.
*   **Dynamic Weekly AI Recaps**: At the end of each week (or when you choose to generate it), ThoughtReflex creates a personalized summary of your journal entries from the past seven days. Mira identifies emotional trends, victories, and struggles from your actual writings. View individual recaps in detail.
*   **Personalized Insights Page**: Uncover deeper patterns in your emotional landscape with dynamically generated insights based on your recent activity:
    *   **Emotion Trends**: Visualizes sentiment (positive, negative, neutral scores) from your recent weekly recaps in a bar chart.
    *   **Recurring Themes (Text Analysis)**: Identifies common topics and their frequency from your journal entries over the last 30 days.
    *   **Detected Emotional Patterns (AI Chat)**: Visualizes recurring emotional themes (e.g., anxiety, self-doubt) Mira has detected during your chat sessions in a pie chart.
    *   **Key Suggestions**: Offers personalized observations and actionable suggestions based on your recent journaling activity.
*   **Journaling Streaks**: Stay motivated with daily journaling streaks! The app tracks your current and longest streaks, displayed in the header. Streaks are updated when you make your first journal entry of the day.
*   **Daily Mood Logging**: Log your daily mood (Positive, Neutral, Negative) on the dashboard. The logged mood is displayed with a colored indicator.
*   **Daily AI Affirmation**: Start your day with a short, uplifting affirmation automatically generated by Mira, displayed on your dashboard.
*   **Daily Guided Topic System**:
    *   Each day, Mira introduces a new healing theme (e.g., Self-Compassion, Gratitude).
    *   Users answer 3-5 scale-based questions to gauge their state on that topic.
    *   Mira provides a personalized therapeutic reflection, journal prompt, and optional resource based on their scores.
    *   Responses are saved per user per day, and the dashboard indicates completion.
*   **Mind Shifts Collection**: Save and review successful thought reframes you've developed with Mira's help on a dedicated "Mind Shifts" page.
*   **Secure User Authentication**:
    *   Sign up and log in securely using Email/Password.
    *   Option to sign in with Google OAuth for quick access.
*   **Session Management**:
    *   Rename your AI journal sessions for better organization.
    *   Delete entire AI journal sessions if needed (with all messages).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of ThoughtReflex up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url/thoughtreflex.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd thoughtreflex
    ```

2.  **Set up Firebase**:
    *   Create a new Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   In your Firebase project, enable the following services:
        *   **Authentication**: Enable "Email/Password" and "Google" sign-in methods.
            *   Go to Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains and add `localhost`.
        *   **Firestore Database**: Create a Firestore database in Native mode.
    *   Go to **Project settings** > **General**. Under "Your apps", click the Web icon (`</>`) to add a web app.
    *   Register your app and copy the Firebase configuration object.

3.  **Environment Variables**:
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (you can copy `.env.example` if it exists, or create it from scratch).
    *   Open the `.env` file and fill in your Firebase project's configuration details. These **must** be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`:
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" # Optional for Analytics
        ```
    *   **Important**: You will also need to set up Google Cloud credentials for Genkit if you haven't already. Ensure your Google Cloud project (which is linked to your Firebase project) has the "Vertex AI API" (or "AI Platform Training & Prediction API" for older projects) enabled. Follow Genkit documentation for authenticating your local environment (e.g., using `gcloud auth application-default login`).

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

5.  **Run the Development Servers**:
    You'll need to run two separate development servers: one for the Next.js application and one for Genkit (which handles the AI flows).

    *   **Next.js App**:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will typically start the app on `http://localhost:9002` (or another port if 9002 is busy).

    *   **Genkit AI Flows** (in a new terminal window/tab):
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        # or for watching changes:
        # npm run genkit:watch
        ```
        This will start the Genkit development server, usually on `http://localhost:3400`. The Next.js app will make requests to this server for AI functionalities.

6.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` (or your Next.js app's port).

## Firestore Security Rules

For production, and even for robust development, you **must** set up Firestore security rules to protect user data. A comprehensive example is provided below. Apply these in the Firebase console under Firestore Database > Rules.

```json
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // User profile document
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Allow reads if authenticated and is the owner.
      // Allow updates if authenticated and is the owner for most fields.
      // Allow create if authenticated (e.g., on signup).
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Goals subcollection
    match /users/{userId}/goals/{goalId} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Journal Sessions subcollection
    match /users/{userId}/journalSessions/{sessionId} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Messages subcollection within Journal Sessions
      match /messages/{messageId} {
        allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }

    // Weekly Recaps subcollection
    match /users/{userId}/weeklyRecaps/{recapId} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Notebook Entries subcollection
    match /users/{userId}/notebookEntries/{entryId} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Daily Moods subcollection (for mood logging)
    match /users/{userId}/dailyMoods/{dateString} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Mind Shifts subcollection
    match /users/{userId}/mindShifts/{shiftId} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Daily Topics collection (publicly readable for all users)
    match /dailyTopics/{topicId} {
      allow read: if true; // Or: if request.auth != null; if you want only logged-in users to see them
      allow write: if false; // Typically managed by admins
    }

    // Testimonials collection (publicly readable if approved and consent given, writable by authenticated users)
    match /testimonials/{testimonialId} {
      allow read: if resource.data.isApproved == true && resource.data.consentGiven == true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      // Admin/moderator would need separate rules for update (e.g., to set isApproved)
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements (Potential Next Steps)

*   **Deeper AI Memory**: Implement long-term memory for Mira across sessions by storing and retrieving key user insights or summaries.
*   **Admin Panel**: For testimonial approval and management of daily topics.
*   **Persistent Insights**: Save generated insights (emotion trends, themes) to Firestore to avoid re-generation on every page visit and allow for historical tracking.
*   **Advanced PWA Features**: More robust offline caching, background sync using service workers.
*   **Notifications**: System-level reminders for journaling or goal check-ins (e.g., using Firebase Cloud Messaging).
*   **Voice Input**: Allow users to speak their journal entries.
*   **File Attachments**: Allow users to attach relevant files/images to journal entries.
*   **More AI Tools**: Potentially add AI tools for specific therapeutic exercises (e.g., guided mindfulness, Socratic questioning).
*   **User Emotional Map (from Feature List)**: Allow users to view and manage what Mira has detected about them.
*   **Server-Side Data Deletion**: For truly robust account data deletion, implement a Firebase Function.
*   **Full Account Deletion**: Implement deletion of the Firebase Auth record in addition to Firestore data.
